**Airbnb Data Analysis and Exploration**

The motto is to upload the sample airbnb json file into MongoDB and explore the documents and collection for understanding. By then, connecting the cluster to a ipynb file to do EDA and visualize in Streamlit/Power BI.

An Airbnb dataset typically refers to a collection of data about properties listed on the Airbnb platform, which is a popular service for renting short-term accommodations. These datasets are often used for analysis, machine learning, and data science projects. The data generally contains a variety of information related to both the properties (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.) and their booking history. While the exact contents may vary depending on the dataset's source, the following key components are commonly found in Airbnb datasets:

Price Prediction: Predicting the price of a property based on its features (location, room type, number of reviews, etc.).
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing reviews to determine overall sentiment towards the property or host.
Recommendation Systems: Building algorithms to recommend properties to users based on their preferences.
Market Analysis: Understanding demand patterns in different cities or neighborhoods, seasonal fluctuations, and occupancy rates.
Clustering/Segmentation: Grouping properties based on common characteristics (e.g., luxury vs. budget accommodations, or tourist hotspots vs. residential areas).
Impact of Reviews: Analyzing how reviews (both ratings and content) affect the price or booking likelihood of a property
